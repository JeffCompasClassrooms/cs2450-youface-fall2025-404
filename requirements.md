Project Name: Geo Caching Ducks

Buisness Context:

There will be posts of ducks in various locations for users to treasure hunt for around the Utah Tech Campus. There will be a leaderboard for the users who find the most ducks.

Problem Statement:
A fun passtime. A way for students to make friends. Bring intrigue to ducks & CS.

Scope:
*in scope* 
Users should be able to guess where the ducks are located using a code system.
*out of scope*
Users cannot post their own locations yet. Users cannot be from outside Utah Tech.

Assumptions:
People leave the ducks in their place. People don't cheat or mess it up for others.

Features:
Users will be able to get hints and enter a duck code to mark as found. Users can make friends with each other on the site. Users can get small on-site rewards for their duck-finds. Users can help each other out.


Non-functional requirements:
It should be useable for mobile and desktop.
Ducks should get updated with new locations.
