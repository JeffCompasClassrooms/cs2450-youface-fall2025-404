Project Name: 

Geo Caching Ducks

Buisness Context:

There will be posts and hints for scattered ducks in various locations for users to treasure hunt for around the Utah Tech Campus. There will be a leaderboard and incentives for the users who are the quickest and find the most ducks.

Problem Statement:

A fun passtime. A way for students to make friends. Bring intrigue to ducks & CS at UT.

Scope:

*in scope* 

Users should be able to guess where the ducks are located using a code system.

*out of scope*

Users cannot post their own locations yet. Users cannot be from outside Utah Tech.

Assumptions:

-People leave the ducks in their place. 

-People don't cheat or mess the game up for others.

Features:

Users will be able to get hints and enter a duck code to mark as found. They can make friends with each other on the site, recieve small on-site rewards for their duck-finds, and can help each other out.

Non-functional requirements:

-It should be useable for mobile and desktop.

-Ducks should get updated with new locations.
